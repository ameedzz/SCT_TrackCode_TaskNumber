# House Price Prediction using Regression

This project demonstrates how to build a **House Price Prediction model** using **Linear Regression** in Python. It uses a sample housing dataset with features such as **living area**, **number of bedrooms**, and **number of bathrooms** to predict house prices.

Let us walk through the task 
---

## Features of the Project !!

* Reads data from a CSV file (`housing_sample.csv`)
* Preprocesses the data (handles missing values and scales features)
* Splits data into **training** and **testing** sets
* Trains a **Linear Regression model** using scikit-learn
* Evaluates the model using:

  * Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  * RÂ² Score
  * Model Accuracy
* Visualizes **Actual vs Predicted Prices** using a scatter plot
* Allows **user input** to predict house price interactively

## Sample Dataset (`housing_sample.csv`)

The dataset contains:

* `GrLivArea` â†’ Living area (sq ft)
* `BedroomAbvGr` â†’ Number of bedrooms
* `FullBath` â†’ Number of full bathrooms
* `SalePrice` â†’ House price (target variable)
